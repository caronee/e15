## Notes for instructor

I tried to do the 'retain old form data' for the dropdown but it doesn't seem to work since I am pulling the options values from a json file.

I'd like to figure out how to retain old form data for dropdown lists if possible.


 Also I spent a very long time with the form logic since I wanted it to come up with values even if they were empty, which the form kept trying to match for null. That's why I have a hundred if statements in the middle of my search controller. It took a very long time which is why this is late.
